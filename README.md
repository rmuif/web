# RMUIF

RMUIF is the acronym for this project’s previous name, [React](https://reactjs.org) + [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) + [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), which are the three musketeers that make up this template. With [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) at its core, you can expect the same tooling to work out of the box. It is essentially a “supercharged” version of CRA with all the bells and whistles.

## Features

There are lots of features included in this template by default, some of the most prominent are:

- Bootstrapped with Create React App; the same tooling works out of the box for that instant web development gratification
- Initial UI scaffolding incorporates Google’s Material Design through the Material-UI framework
- Built on top of a Firebase back-end with most of their products for the web included, e.g. Authentication and Cloud Firestore
- Robust routing with React Router including protected routes and error handling
- Extensive and well-tested mobile support with full-screen dialogs and swipeable tabs
- Quality assurance through the cross-platform application monitoring tool Sentry
